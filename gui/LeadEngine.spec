"""
PyInstaller spec for the Lead Engine desktop app.

Build (on Windows):  pyinstaller gui/LeadEngine.spec
Output:              dist/LeadEngine.exe  (one self-contained file)

Notes
-----
- The verticals in leadgen/verticals are imported for their REGISTER side effect,
  so PyInstaller's static analysis can miss them — they're forced via hiddenimports.
- duckdb is heavy and only needed for the Overture source; it's included so the
  bundled app supports both sources out of the box.
