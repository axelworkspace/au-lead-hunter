"""
The Vertical spec + registry.

A Vertical is a plain dataclass describing one prospecting use case. The engine
reads it; you never subclass anything. One is shipped (web_design) as a worked
example; add your own by writing one file in verticals/ and calling register().
See docs/ADD_A_VERTICAL.md.

Hook functions all take/return plain dicts so verticals stay simple and testable:

    enrich_fn(rec, ctx)  -> mutates/returns rec with extra fields  (optional)
    score_fn(rec)        -> (score:int, tier:str, reasons:str)     (required)
    opener_fn(rec)       -> str  call/email opener                 (optional)
    suppression_fn(cfg)  -> set[str] normalized names to sink      (optional)
